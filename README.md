This is a weather forecast website I developped using OpenWeather's functioning API. With HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the website has a search box asking for the user 
to search any city in the world, and once the user presses enter the website will display the city's name, country, the date, as well as the weather in the current time,
which includes the current temperature, the state of the atmosphere, as well as the maximum and minimum recorded temperatures for that current time. You can try it by
